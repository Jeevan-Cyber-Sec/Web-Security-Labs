# Lab: SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data

## Platform
PortSwigger Web Security Academy

## Vulnerability Type
SQL Injection

## Severity
High

## Lab Objective
Perform a SQL injection attack that causes the application to display one or more unreleased products.

## Vulnerable Component
- Endpoint: /filter
- HTTP Method: GET
- Parameter: category

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Access the lab using Burp Suite's built-in browser.
2. Navigate to the product category filter.
3. Intercept the request using Burp Suite.
4. Modify the `category` parameter with the following payload: '+OR+1=1--
5. Forward the request to the server.

## Result
The application returned all products regardless of category,
confirming the SQL injection vulnerability.

## Impact
An attacker could bypass application logic and retrieve
unauthorized data from the backend database, potentially
exposing sensitive information.

## Proof of Concept
Screenshots demonstrate the injected payload, server response,
and successful lab completion.

## Mitigation
- Use parameterized SQL queries (prepared statements) to ensure that user-supplied
  input is treated strictly as data and not executable SQL code.
- Avoid dynamically constructing SQL queries using string concatenation with
  user-controlled input.
- Implement server-side input validation by enforcing allow-lists for expected
  category values (e.g., predefined product categories).
- Apply the principle of least privilege to database accounts so that the
  application cannot access or modify unauthorized data even if a SQL injection
  occurs.
- Enable proper error handling to prevent SQL error messages or query behavior
  from being exposed to end users.
